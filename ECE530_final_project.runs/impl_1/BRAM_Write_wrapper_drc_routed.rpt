PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net BRAM_Write_i/ImageProcess_0/inst/unit_AddrManager/ram_reg_1 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin BRAM_Write_i/ImageProcess_0/inst/unit_AddrManager/RAMsel3_reg_i_1/O, cell BRAM_Write_i/ImageProcess_0/inst/unit_AddrManager/RAMsel3_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 BRAM_Write_i/ImageProcess_0/inst/SorterLineBuffer_4lines/LineBuffer0/ram_reg_0 has an input control pin BRAM_Write_i/ImageProcess_0/inst/SorterLineBuffer_4lines/LineBuffer0/ram_reg_0/ADDRARDADDR[10] (net: BRAM_Write_i/ImageProcess_0/inst/SorterLineBuffer_4lines/LineBuffer0/H_addr[6]) which is driven by a register (BRAM_Write_i/ImageProcess_0/inst/unit_AddrManager/H_addr_reg[6]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 BRAM_Write_i/ImageProcess_0/inst/SorterLineBuffer_4lines/LineBuffer0/ram_reg_1 has an input control pin BRAM_Write_i/ImageProcess_0/inst/SorterLineBuffer_4lines/LineBuffer0/ram_reg_1/ADDRARDADDR[4] (net: BRAM_Write_i/ImageProcess_0/inst/SorterLineBuffer_4lines/LineBuffer0/H_addr[1]) which is driven by a register (BRAM_Write_i/ImageProcess_0/inst/unit_AddrManager/H_addr_reg[1]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
